# Wild Bunch Events

Wild Bunch Events is an event management app targeted toward
WhatsApp social group called "The Wild Bunch." The app allows users to
create, manage and map to events. Users can view events without logging
in. Creating, updating, and deleting events requires a registered and
verified user account. Mapping to events triggers a call to Google Maps
JavaScript API to display the route to the event address.
